# nerds.family App

Front-end web application project built for the recruitment task.

It was built in the `React.js` ecosystem, including, among others `React-Router-Dom`. It also uses the `Sass` preprocessor in the Scss variant (with `Flexbox` and `BEM` methodology).

The view layer tries to reproduce the `Figma` design, although at the current stage of development it requires improvement. The structure and logic of the application take into account `business goals`, based on `mockup data`.

I tried to develop the structure of the code and the application taking into account the basic paradigms of modern programming.

Deploy was made using `Heroku`.
